# Terraform Lambda DynamoDB

API Gateway to Lambda to DynamoDB using Terraform.

## Quickstart

### 1. Read the docs

Set up your AWS command line

Follow Terraform's getting started documentation

https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started

### 2. Read the terraform config

Read `main.tf` â€” It's aimed at being a small single file that does something useful.

We could get fancier, but this can be a benefit for first timers to discover!

### 2. Deploy

`terraform apply`

### 3. Clean up

`terraform destroy`
